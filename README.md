# SatMap: Geological Mapping From Space
## Overview
This repository contains the research and findings from my master's thesis on "Geological Mapping from Space." The primary objective of this project is to explore and assess the capabilities of recent satellite missions  relative to airborne hyperspectral sensor for geological mapping.
## Mission Involvement
The study focuses on three key satellite missions: 
1. **PRISMA (Italian Mission):** [https://prisma.asi.it/]
2. **EnMAP (German Mission):** [https://planning.enmap.org/]
3. **EMIT (NASA Mission):** [https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/]

Additionally, data from the HyMap airborne hyperspectral sensor is incorporated into the analysis.
## Repository Contents
The repository includes:
- Jupyter notebooks with detailed analyses and code implementations.
- Data preprocessing scripts and tools.
## How to Use
Feel free to explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the methodologies and analyses conducted. If you find the work valuable, consider adapting the code for your own projects. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!
## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to the following teams and tools for their valuable contributions to this research:
- **HIF-HZDR (Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology):** Special thanks to the Hif-Explo team for their support and resources, which played a crucial role in the success of this project.

- **Hylite Toolbox:** The Hylite toolbox significantly facilitated data processing and analysis. The tools provided by the Hylite team were instrumental in extracting meaningful insights from hyperspectral data.
